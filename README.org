* ExMLS - MLS in Elixir
This is (or rather, is going to be) an implementation of the
Messaging Layer Security (MLS) Protocol, as defined by the [[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9420][RFC 9420]].

** Why Elixir?
Because I always wanted an excuse to learn the language.
Also, there is currently no MLS implementation for Elixir (2023-10-11).

** Current Status
All the types (structs, enums, opaques) of the RFC are implemented.

** How to use this project
If you have [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] installed, just run ~nix build~.
This currently builds a self-contained binary using [[https://github.com/bake-bake-bake/bakeware][Bakeware]].
You can also ~direnv allow~ or ~nix develop~ to enter a development environment.
A testsuite is defined in the [[file:Justfile]], run ~just test~.

** Ultimate goals
- a complete implementation of MLS, conforming to the RFC
- an example chat client & server using the implementation
